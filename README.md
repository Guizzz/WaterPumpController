# üöÄ WaterPumpController üíß

**Control your domestic water pump and monitor ambient temperature and humidity, all via WiFi with a simple REST API!**

This project uses an ESP8266 (but also for ESP32) board to give you smart control over your home's water pump and to keep an eye on the environmental conditions of the room where it's installed. Interact with the system through an intuitive REST API.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Remote Pump Control:** Turn your water pump ON and OFF via WiFi.
* **Environmental Monitoring:** Get real-time temperature and humidity readings.
* **RESTful API:** Simple and standard interface for integration with other systems or applications.
* **Programmable Timers:** Set timers to automatically activate or deactivate the pump.
* **Daily Routines:** Configure daily ON/OFF cycles.
* **Easy Configuration:** Customize WiFi and sensor settings via a configuration file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

### 1. Initial Configuration

To get the project running, you need to create a configuration file with your WiFi credentials and other settings.

1.  In the `include` folder of the project, create a new file named `config.h`.
2.  Copy and paste the following code into the `config.h` file, customizing the values:

    ```cpp
    #ifndef CONFIG_H
    #define CONFIG_H

    // WiFi Settings
    #define WIFI_SSID         "YOUR_WIFI_NAME"
    #define WIFI_PASSWORD     "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"

    // Sensor reading interval (in seconds)
    #define SENSOR_READING_TIME  5

    #endif // CONFIG_H
    ```

### 2. Wiring üîå

This project assumes the use of an ESP32 board. Here's the wiring diagram:

| Component               | ESP32 Pin | Function    | Notes                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pump Relay              | 5         | Control     | Default pin. Modifiable in `~/lib/pinManager/pinManager.h`.             |
| Sensor Data (SDA)       | 14        | I2C Data    | For I2C compatible temperature/humidity sensor (and/or screen).          |
| Sensor Clock (SCL)      | 12        | I2C Clock   | For I2C compatible temperature/humidity sensor (and/or screen).          |

* **Note:** The relay pin is set to `5` for a board with an embedded relay. If you use an external relay module, connect its control pin to your desired ESP32 pin and update `pinManager.h` accordingly.
* Ensure your temperature and humidity sensor (e.g., DHT22, AM2320, SHT31) is I2C compatible and correctly wired to the defined SDA and SCL pins.

## üì° API Endpoints Documentation

The system exposes the following REST endpoints for control and monitoring. All successful responses are in JSON format with HTTP status code `200 OK`.

---

### `GET /get_temp`

Retrieves the current temperature and humidity readings.

* **Method:** `GET`
* **Parameters:** None
* **Sample Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "temperature": 23.5,
      "humidity": 55.8
    }
    ```

---

### `GET /get_status`

Gets the current system status, including relay state, number of active timers, and whether a routine is running.

* **Method:** `GET`
* **Parameters:** None
* **Sample Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "relay_status": true,  // true: ON (active), false: OFF (inactive)
      "active_timer": 0,     // Number of currently active timers
      "active_routine": false // true: a routine is running, false: no routine active
    }
    ```

---

### `POST /set`

Sets the state of the relay (and thus the pump).

* **Method:** `POST`
* **Parameters (Query String):**
    * `RELAY` (string, required): Desired state of the relay. Possible values: `ON` or `OFF`.
* **Sample Call:**
    `POST /set?RELAY=ON`
* **Response:** Same schema as `/get_status`, reflecting the new state.

---

### `POST /create_timer`

Creates a timer to change the relay state after a specified time interval.

* **Method:** `POST`
* **Parameters (Query String):**
    * `RELAY` (string, required): State the relay will assume when the timer ends (`ON` or `OFF`).
    * `TIMER` (integer, required): Timer duration in seconds.
* **Sample Call:**
    `POST /create_timer?RELAY=OFF&TIMER=3600` (Turns off the relay after 1 hour)
* **Response:** Same schema as `/get_status`.

---

### `POST /create_routine`

Creates a daily routine to turn the relay ON and OFF at specific times.

* **Method:** `POST`
* **Parameters (Query String):**
    * `start_hour` (integer, required): Routine start hour (24h format, 0-23).
    * `start_minute` (integer, required): Routine start minute (0-59).
    * `stop_hour` (integer, required): Routine stop hour (24h format, 0-23).
    * `stop_minute` (integer, required): Routine stop minute (0-59).
* **Sample Call:**
    `POST /create_routine?start_hour=7&start_minute=0&stop_hour=8&stop_minute=30` (Activates the relay from 07:00 to 08:30 every day)
* **Response:** Same schema as `/get_status`.

---

### `DELETE /delete_routine`

Deletes the currently set daily routine.

* **Method:** `DELETE`
* **Parameters:** None
* **Response:** Same schema as `/get_status`.

## üí° Additional Notes

* This project is a great starting point. Feel free to expand, modify, and adapt it to your needs!
* When exposing devices on your local network, or even worse, on the Internet, always consider the **security** implications.
* Have fun with your ESP32 project!
